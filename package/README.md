# zenoh_dart

> ## ⚠️ NOT FOR PRODUCTION
>
> **This package is pre-1.0 and under active development. It is good enough to
> experiment with — it is not good enough to build a product on.**
>
> It is published to make the work visible and to let people try it, not because it
> is ready. Expect breaking changes without deprecation cycles.
>
> **Targets are narrow.** Linux `x86_64` and Android `arm64-v8a` / `x86_64` only.
> There is no macOS, Windows, iOS or web support — the build hook fails outright on
> those targets.
>
> **Android is feature-reduced, not merely a different platform.** Shared memory
> (`ShmProvider`, `ShmMutBuffer`) and advanced pub/sub (`AdvancedPublisher`,
> `AdvancedSubscriber`) are compiled out; calling them on Android fails at symbol
> lookup.
>
> **Versions `0.2.0` and earlier under this name are an unrelated project** that no
> longer has any connection to this package. They share no code, no API and no
> maintainer, and nothing they document applies here.

Pure Dart FFI bindings for [Eclipse Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh) — the
pub/sub, query and storage protocol — wrapping
[`zenoh-c`](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c) **v1.7.2** through a thin C shim
layer.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer and routed communication via zenoh
- Publish/subscribe with key expressions
- Query/reply (get/queryable) request-response pattern
- Pull subscriber with ring buffer (lossy, latest-value semantics)
- Declared querier for repeated queries with matching status
- Liveliness tokens for presence detection and subscriber notifications
- Background subscriber (fire-and-forget, lives until session closes)
- Ping/pong latency benchmarking with express publisher mode (heap and SHM)
- Throughput benchmarking (heap tight-loop and SHM zero-copy)
- Cross-language typed serialization/deserialization (ZSerializer, ZDeserializer)
- Raw byte assembly (ZBytesWriter) and fragmented slice iteration
- Byte-exact binary payload **and attachment** delivery (protobuf/flatbuffers/CDR-safe) via `payloadBytes` / `attachmentBytes`, plus attachment + encoding send options and error replies (`replyErr`)
- Advanced pub/sub: publisher cache, history recovery, sample miss detection with heartbeats
- Key expression matching (`intersects`/`includes`/`equals`) for storage-style routing
- Shared memory (SHM) zero-copy for publish, get, and reply (Linux)
- Network scouting and session info
- Build hooks for seamless native library distribution

## Getting Started

```dart
import 'package:zenoh_dart/zenoh.dart';

void main() async {
  final session = Session.open();

  // Publish
  session.put('demo/hello', 'Hello from Dart!');

  // Subscribe
  final subscriber = session.declareSubscriber('demo/**');
  subscriber.stream.listen((sample) {
    print('${sample.keyExpr}: ${sample.payload}');
  });

  // Declare a publisher
  final publisher = session.declarePublisher('demo/counter');
  publisher.put('value');

  // Query/reply
  final replies = session.get('demo/**');
  await for (final reply in replies) {
    if (reply.isOk) print('${reply.ok.keyExpr}: ${reply.ok.payload}');
  }

  // Clean up
  subscriber.close();
  publisher.close();
  session.close();
}
```

Binary payloads **and attachments** round-trip byte-exact: publish with `putBytes(key, ZBytes.fromUint8List(bytes), attachment: ZBytes.fromUint8List(meta))` and read `sample.payloadBytes` / `sample.attachmentBytes` on receive (the `payload` / `attachment` Strings are lenient display views — invalid UTF-8 renders as U+FFFD).

## Real-world examples

Two open-source Flutter applications drive a PincherX-100 robot arm over Zenoh
using this package. Both run against a simulator in Docker with rviz — no
hardware required.

| App | What it demonstrates |
|-----|----------------------|
| [flutter_zenoh_gateway](https://github.com/bluecorn/flutter_zenoh_gateway) | App → Zenoh → a thin C++ Zenoh↔ROS gateway node → arm. JSON commands in, `interbotix_xs_msgs` out. |
| [flutter_zenoh_direct](https://github.com/bluecorn/flutter_zenoh_direct) | No gateway node — the app *is* the ROS-over-Zenoh participant. Reads `joint_states`, computes FK, writes `JointGroupCommand` as CDR. |

Each repository's README states the `zenoh_dart` version it targets and how to
bring up the simulator.

Zenoh](https://github.com/bluecorn/flutter-zenoh-robotics-ui-webinar) (slides).
